Examination of spectral data acquired from orbit show that some of these sediments have minerals that indicate chemical alteration by water.

The colors represent differences in minerals exposed on and around the delta with include clays and carbonates that could be high priority targets for exploration by the rover. The delta extends approximately 8 km from the wall and out onto the floor of the crater.</p>

                     <p>Earlier spacecrafts deployed their parachutes as early as possible after the spacecraft reached a desired velocity. Mars 2020's Range Trigger deploys the parachute based on the spacecraft's position relative to the desired landing target. That means the parachute could be deployed early or later depending on how close it is to its desired target. If the spacecraft were going to overshoot the landing target, the parachute would be deployed earlier. If it were going to fall short of the target, the parachute would be deployed later, after the spacecraft flew a little closer to its target while doing trajectory corrections. The module then separates from the parachute, finds a suitable landing spot using its new enhanced cameras and then deploys the skycrane and drops the rover. The booster module then untethers and flies a few hundered meters and crashes.</p>
